# Sliding_Puzzle_Solver
Created a Board and a Solver class to that works correctly for arbitrary n-by-n boards (for any 2 ≤ n ≤ 128)

 The sliding block puzzle is played on an n-by-n grid with n^2 - 1 square blocks labeled 1 through n^2 - 1 and a blank square.
 
 Your goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order, using as few moves as possible. 
 
 You are permitted to slide blocks horizontally or vertically into the blank square. 
 
 My solution uses a general artificial intelligence methodology known as the A* search algorithm and a princeton's minimum priority queue API
